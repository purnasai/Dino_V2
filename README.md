#### Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision
Check out the paper here DINOv2: [Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193)

`inspired from original Facebook Meta AI repo`.

#### 1. Feature Visualization:
- Like Mentioned in paper, I have used the features from Images using 2 step-PCA to visualize in a fashion showed in paper. The above visualization is the result of it.
#### 2. Image Classification:
- I also have used DinoV2 for Classification, and compared it with Resnets(might not be a fair comparision of transformers vs CNNs).

#### 3. Image Search/Retrieval
- I have also used DinoV2 for Image similarity, extracted image features form Database of Images, Used A Query image to query against the Database of Images. We used **FAISS** for quick Retrieval.

#### Notes:
- Paralell Processing is not required at Faiss Search Time, since Faiss Already implements it.
- Paralell Processing at Feature creation for Database images is helpful.
- We are currently using Faiss.IndexL2 with Normalized Vectors which is Cosine Similarity, But IVFPQ(Inverted File pointer Quantization) + HNSW Of FAISS can Search Billions Of Points in MilliSeconds & Can be added Later.
- The Training/finetuning of DinoV2 on CustomData is same as training Regular computer vision models.

#### TODO:
- [X] Adding PCA Visualization
- [X] Adding DinoV2 VS Resnet Classification
- [X] Adding Faiss indexing in ImageRetrival

Please Give credits if one use this repo for any purpose. It would be helpful. Thank you
