#### Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision
Check out the paper here DINOv2: [Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193)

`inspired from original Facebook Meta AI repo`.

- Like Mentioned in paper, I have used the features from Images using 2 step-PCA to visualize in a fashion showed in paper. The above visualization is the result of it.
- I also have used DinoV2 for Classification, and compared it with Resnets(might not be a fair comparision of transformers vs CNNs).

#### TODO:
- [X] Adding PCA Visualization
- [X] Adding DinoV2 VS Resnet Classification
- [ ] Adding KNN clustering
- [ ] Adding Faiss indexing in ImageRetrival
